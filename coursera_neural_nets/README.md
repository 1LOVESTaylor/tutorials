## Neural Networks for Machine Learning (Coursera)
First two assignments from the [Coursera Neural Networks class](https://www.coursera.org/course/neuralnets) converted from Matlab to Torch7.

### Installation
- [gfx.js](https://github.com/clementfarabet/gfx.js) for graphs.
- [matio](https://github.com/soumith/matio-ffi.torch) for loading matlab data files without having matlab installed. 

Make sure gfx.js is running for running Assignment 1.

``` sh
 luajit -lgfx.start
```

Each assignment contains a starter_code folder where you can begin the assignment. 

Once complete you can compare against the solution folder.

### Assignment 1

Perceptron Algorithm.

### Assignment 2
Neural network to predict next word in a sentence.
